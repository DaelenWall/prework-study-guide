# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## This project was an interesting and immersive introduction to coding that I thoroughly enjoyed. I did this project because I knew that in order to be really good at something, you have to start with the basics, and learning about the various git commands as well as the beginner languages was exactly what I needed. Now I have a study guide that I can use at any time as a refresher for times that I get a bit lost in my work. Overall, I learned that coding is a wonderfully complex set of languages that can be used to solve real world problems, but it requires a lot of time, effort, and patience.

## This Prework Study Guide can be used as a refresher for whenever the user is lost or confused at a certain point in their coding. The guide provides different commands as well as explanations for what each language can be used for and definitions for vital vocabulary words. For example, if the user were to forget what branch they are currently coding in, they could simply run the command, 'git status', and solve their problem immediately.
